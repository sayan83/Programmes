/*
Chef is a very experienced and well-known cook. 
He has participated in many cooking competitions in the past â€” so many that he does not even remember them all.

One of these competitions lasted for a certain number of days. The first day of the competition was day 
S of the week (i.e. Monday, Tuesday etc.) and the last day was day E of the week. 
Chef remembers that the duration of the competition (the number of days between the first and last day, inclusive)
was between L days and R days inclusive. Is it possible to uniquely determine the exact duration of the competition? 
If so, what is this duration?
